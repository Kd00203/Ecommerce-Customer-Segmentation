# E-commerce Customer Segmentation and Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce customer purchasing behavior to segment customers into meaningful groups and predict customer segments using machine learning. The goal is to help businesses design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize revenue generation.

Customer segmentation is performed using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **clustering techniques**, while predictive modeling is applied to classify customers into predefined segments. An interactive **Power BI dashboard** is also developed to visualize key insights and support business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer purchasing behavior using transactional data
- Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis
- Identify high-value, loyal, at-risk, and low-value customers
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models
- Optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning
- Provide actionable business insights through visual dashboards

## 📊 Results & Key Findings
- Customers were successfully segmented into **four distinct groups**
- **Random Forest** achieved the best predictive performance after tuning
- **Recency** was identified as the most influential feature
- A small segment of customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue
- The analysis supports targeted marketing and retention strategies
